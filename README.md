# Responsive Nav

### Responsive navigation plugin without library dependencies and with fast touch screen support.

[Responsive Nav](http://responsive-nav.com) is a tiny JavaScript plugin which weighs only 1.7 KB minified and Gzip’ed, and helps you to create a toggled navigation for small screens. It uses touch events and CSS3 transitions for the best possible performance. It also contains a “clever” workaround that makes it possible to transition from `height: 0` to `height: auto`, which isn’t normally possible with CSS3 transitions.


#### Features:

* Simple, semantic markup.
* Weighs only 1.7 KB minified and Gzip’ed.
* Doesn’t require any external library.
* Uses CSS3 transitions and touch events.
* Removes the 300 ms delay between a physical tap and the click event.
* Makes it possible to use CSS3 transitions with height: auto.
* Built with accessibility in mind, meaning that everything works on screen readers and with JavaScript disabled, too.
* Works in all major desktop and mobile browsers, including IE 6 and up.
* Free to use under the MIT license.
