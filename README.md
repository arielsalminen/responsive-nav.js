# Responsive Nav

### Responsive navigation plugin without library dependencies and with fast touch screen support.

[Responsive Nav](http://responsive-nav.com) is a tiny JavaScript plugin which weighs only 1.3kb minified and Gzip’ed, and helps you to create a toggled navigation for small screens. It uses touch events and CSS3 transitions for the best possible performance. It also contains a “clever” workaround that makes it possible to transition from `height: 0` to `height: auto`, which isn’t normally possible with CSS3 transitions.


#### Features:

* Simple, semantic markup.
* Weighs only 1.3kb minified and Gzip’ed.
* Doesn’t require any external library.
* Uses CSS3 transitions and touch events.
* Supports RequireJS and multiple instances.
* Removes the 300ms delay between a physical tap and the click event.
* Makes it possible to use CSS3 transitions with height: auto.
* Built with accessibility in mind, meaning that everything works on screen readers and with JavaScript disabled, too.
* Works in all major desktop and mobile browsers, including IE 6 and up.
* Free to use under the MIT license.

# Usage instructions

Following the steps below you will be able to get the plugin up and running. If you notice any bugs, please post them to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/arielsalminen/responsive-nav.js/issues).

1. Link files:
	```html
		<!-- Put these into the <head> -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="responsive-nav.css">
		<script src="responsive-nav.js"></script>
	```

1. Add markup:
	```html
		<nav class="nav-collapse">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">About</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Projects</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
		 	</ul>
		</nav>
	```

1. Hook up the plugin:
	```html
	<!-- Put this right before the </body> closing tag -->
		<script>
			var nav = responsiveNav(".nav-collapse");
		</script>
	```

1. Customizable options:
	```javascript
		var nav = responsiveNav(".nav-collapse", { // Selector
			animate: true, // Boolean: Use CSS3 transitions, true or false
			transition: 284, // Integer: Speed of the transition, in milliseconds
			label: "Menu", // String: Label for the navigation toggle
			insert: "before", // String: Insert the toggle before or after the navigation
			customToggle: "", // Selector: Specify the ID of a custom toggle
			closeOnNavClick: false, // Boolean: Close the navigation when one of the links are clicked
			openPos: "relative", // String: Position of the opened nav, relative or static
			navClass: "nav-collapse", // String: Default CSS class. If changed, you need to edit the CSS too!
			navActiveClass: "js-nav-active", // String: Class that is added to <html> element when nav is active
			jsClass: "js", // String: 'JS enabled' class which is added to <html> element
			init: function(){}, // Function: Init callback
			open: function(){}, // Function: Open callback
			close: function(){} // Function: Close callback
		});
	```


# Public methods

See the [example code here](https://github.com/arielsalminen/responsive-nav.js/blob/master/demos/public-events/index.html) for the usage.

`nav.toggle();`

`nav.open();`

`nav.close();`

`nav.destroy();`

`nav.resize();`


# Changing the breakpoint

Breakpoint is defined in the [responsive-nav.css](https://github.com/arielsalminen/responsive-nav.js/blob/master/responsive-nav.css) file. Responsive Nav checks on window resize and on orientation change if the navigation toggle has `display: none;` and based on that switches between mobile and desktop states.


# Supporting old IEs

Even though Responsive Nav works even on IE6, you should remember that IE8 and under do not support media queries and thus can’t change between "small screen" and "large screen" styles. If needed, you can add Media Query support for those browsers using [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond). There’s an example [here](https://github.com/arielsalminen/responsive-nav.js/tree/master/demos/ie-support-using-respondjs).

When old IE support is needed you should stick to using ID selector with Responsive Nav. That’s because the plugin uses `getElementById` method by default which is widely supported in all browsers. When using classes or element selectors `querySelector` will be used instead which isn’t supported in old IEs.


# Things to keep in mind

Calculated Max-height doesn't account for top/bottom padding on `.nav-collapse` (this is on purpose). If you need to add padding inside the nav, you can apply it to any other element, for example the `<ul>` inside `.nav-collapse`.

# Working on the repository

[GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) is used for the build process, which means node and npm are required. If you already have those on your machine, you can install Grunt and all dependencies required for the build using:

```sh
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
```


## Starting the server

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```


## Git Hooks

It is useful to setup a pre-commit and post-checkout hooks to smooth your workflow. On pre-commit we want to ensure that the project can build successfully, and on post-checkout we want to ensure that any new dependencies are installed via npm.


### Pre-Commit

```sh
touch .git/hooks/pre-commit && echo -e '#!/bin/sh\ngrunt test' > .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```


### Post-Checkout

```sh
touch .git/hooks/post-checkout && echo -e '#!/bin/sh\nnpm install\nexit 0' > .git/hooks/post-checkout && chmod +x .git/hooks/post-checkout
```

## Building The Project

To build the project, run unit tests etc. enter the following at the terminal:

```sh
grunt
```

Grunt can also be used to monitor files and re-build the project on each change. For this we use Grunt's watch task:

```sh
grunt watch
```

Next time you change the file, Grunt will perform all build tasks.


## Testing

The test suite can be run with `grunt test` and is also part of the default Grunt task. This command runs all tests locally using PhantomJS.

### Running on multiple devices/browsers

It's possible to run the test suite on multiple devices with Karma.

The Karma server can be started with `grunt karma` and multiple browsers should then point to the machine running the server on port 9876 (e.g. http://localhost:9876). Once the browsers are connected, the test suite can be run with `grunt karma:all:run`.

An easier way to test on multiple devices as part of the development cycle is to use karma with the watch task. Running `grunt karma watch` will automatically start the Karma server in the background and will run the tests automatically every time a file changes, on every connected device.

`1.0.32` (2014-03-05) - Ditching the `[].forEach.call(NodeList)` hack to make the code more sensible and future-proof.

`1.0.31` (2014-03-02) - Fixes Chrome Mobile rendering issue.

`1.0.30` (2014-03-02) - Better performance. New [fixed navigation example](https://github.com/adtile/fixed-nav) provided by [Adtile](https://twitter.com/adtilehq). This release fixes an issue where multiple navigations on the same page got the same calculated height. Toggle now has an "active" class when the nav is open. Two new options are added: "closeOnNavClick" and "navActiveClass". Two new methods are also added: "open" and "close" (thanks to [@munkius](https://github.com/munkius) for the heads up on this!). This release adds also better "hamburger" icon for advanced demos which you can now style via css (size, color, shadow & etc). Includes also other bug fixes targeting older Android devices.

`1.0.25` (2013-12-13) - Fixes ghost click issues on Android + a problem where calculated max-height might get overridden under certain circumstances.

`1.0.24` (2013-11-27) - Adds new option called "navClass." All tests should also work now on real iOS, Windows Phone and Android devices (when using grunt-karma), and not just with PhantomJS.

`1.0.23` (2013-09-25) - Fixes IE8 bugs + starts using automated builds and tests.

`1.0.22` (2013-09-19) - Public resize method (to allow calling resize manually when needed).

`1.0.21` (2013-09-18) - Multiple instances are now possible thanks to [@toomuchdesign](https://github.com/toomuchdesign). Uses classes instead of ID's now by default, but can be configured to use ID's if old IE support is needed (check the "ie-support" folder in demos).

`1.0.20` (2013-08-12) - Uses now touchmove & touchend, which means that the menu doesn’t trigger anymore if the user starts moving finger instead of just tapping. Also fixes one Android bug and a bug which appeared when tapping the toggle really fast over and over. Plugin’s Functionality doesn’t depent on window load event anymore so it works now with tools like require.js too.

`1.0.16` (2013-08-02) - Set `navOpen` state in the `_init` method. Thanks [@nicolashery](https://github.com/nicolashery)!
