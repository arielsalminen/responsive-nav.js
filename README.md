# Responsive Nav

### Responsive navigation plugin without library dependencies and with fast touch screen support.

Responsive Nav is a tiny JavaScript plugin (weighs 1.5kb minified and gzipped) which helps you to create toggled navigation for smaller screens. It uses touchstart and CSS3 transitions for the best possible performance. It also uses a “clever” workaround which makes it possible to transition from max-height: 0 to max-height: auto which isn’t normally possible with CSS3 transitions.

#### Features:

* Weighs only 1.5kb minified and gzipped.
* Doesn’t require any external libraries.
* Uses CSS3 transitions, touch events and simple markup.
* Removes the 300ms delay between a physical tap and the click event.
* Makes it possible to use CSS3 transitions with max-height: auto.
* Built accessibility in mind, meaning that everything should work on the screen readers too.
* Works in all major desktop and mobile browsers including IE6 and up.
* Navigation is accessible even when JavaScript is disabled.
